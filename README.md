# Koch Snowflake
First on a blog series on the development of short exercises. In this case we take a look at the Koch Snowflake fractal, one of the simplest of its kind. 

What's covered in the file: 
- Creating the equilateral triangle using two methods: 
    - Using just VEX. 
    - Inspired by technical drawing and taking advantage of some of Houdini´s "programming free" nodes.
- VEX code to generate the Koch snowflake inside Houdini's "For each loop" using the "Fetch Feedback" method.  
- Connect the dots to thus create the geometry using VEX.

Article on this one can be found here: https://www.artstation.com/se_carri/blog/Ew9O/koch-snowflake-using-vex

 If you are starting with Houdini and VEX, I hope that you’ve learned something  and if you have any questions, feel free to send me a message and I’ll do my best to help.
